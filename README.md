# Bicycle-Cart
This is group project that I worked on with two other students. All of the files for the cart assembly are located in the prototype zip folder. The drawings for each individual part, assemblies, and sub-assemblies are located in a pdf. This project was done for an introductory mechanical manufacturing class during the Fall semester of 2019.
